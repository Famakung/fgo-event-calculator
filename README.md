## CE Trait Matching

Craft Essences apply bonuses based on servant traits with three modes:

| Mode | Field | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| **OR** | `traits` array | Servant needs ANY matching trait |
| **AND** | `traits` + `matchAll: true` | Servant must have ALL traits |
| **AND/OR** | `traitGroups` | Each group OR-matched; ALL groups must match |
