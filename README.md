## Usage

### Event Shop
1. Enter shop requirements (items needed) and current holdings
2. Set bonus amounts and drop rate multipliers
3. Click "Calculate Quest Runs"

### Bond Calculator
1. Add servants and select from the portrait modal
2. Choose servant type (Normal/Support/Max Bond)
3. For Normal servants, enter bond points needed
4. Add Craft Essences for bonus traits
5. Select a quest
6. Click "Calculate Quest Runs"

### CE Filter

## CE Trait Matching

Craft Essences apply bonuses based on servant traits with four modes:

| Mode | Field | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| **OR** | `traits` array | Servant needs ANY matching trait |
| **AND** | `traits` + `matchAll: true` | Servant must have ALL traits |
| **AND/OR** | `traitGroups` | Each group OR-matched; ALL groups must match |
| **Override** | `alsoMatch` array | Instant match if servant has any listed trait (e.g. servant-specific overrides) |
